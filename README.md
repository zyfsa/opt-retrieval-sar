# opt-retrieval-sar

The work is a bi-retrieval problem between the optical image and SAR image.
We have publish a paper in PCM2018 oral. The title is "Retrieval across Optical and SAR Images with Deep Neural Network".

The code and dataset is private. You are welcome to read the paper and discuss it with me in private.
We can help you evaluate on our data set and use our pre-training model, which is important for training remote sensing images
